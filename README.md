we have air sample the air samples of different locations and then took these samples to his lab where he extracted five features of the air we collected which can be used to predict the air quality index and combined it with the air quality index given in the newspapers. we  are provided with the data  and our job is to design a machine learning model which given the features extracted by Cody can predict

we will use linear regression algo with multiple imputs
